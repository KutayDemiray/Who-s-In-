On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.


### ~ [25.02.2020] ~ 
After having completed the slides together with all group members, we made our project's first presentation with Ceyda.

### ~ [07.03.2020] ~
During our meeting for detailed project report we have brainstormed together to develop our app. I have written the conclusion part for the report. 

### ~ [30.03.2020] ~
During our meeting for GUI presentation, I have written the part for profile tab and homepage for report.

### ~ [23.04.2020] ~ 
After our group meeting, I have googled for about 2-3 hours to find out how to use android studio. Since it is a little bit complicated than developing desktop programmes, I have tried to discover how it actually works to plan our group project. Watched tutorials on YouTube. 

### ~ [29.04.2020] ~
I have continued learning and working Android Studio. After 3 hours, I have completed the mechanic part of tab switching. Created 4 fragments for each tab and attached them into a navigation button. It is now switching through tabs. 

### ~ [02.05.2020] ~
Continued working on the interface of the fragments. Added texts, buttons for each main fragment according to our ui design report. Studied on using buttons to control switching through activites and fragment. Made a random meeting with Ceyda and Gülin to talk about our design. Ceyda sent me the buttons and backgrounds she made and I applied them on xml files.

### ~ [08.05.2020] ~
Added a function to let users sign out from their account. Now they can sign out without actually deleting the app and redownloading :P  

### ~ [10.05.2020] ~
Kutay has successfully implemented an out code to create ewvents and display them. I have tried to implement his code on our application. However, I could not manage it. Kutay has taken the responsibility of CreateEvent class.

### ~ [11.05.2020] ~
Kutay has successfully implemented creating event feature. Now users can create events. I have fixed some errors on his class. If a user does not write anything and still try to create event, the app used to crash. Fixed that error, and added some funny toast messages when users create events with some particular infos xD

### ~ [17.05.2020] ~
Stayed awake until first lights of the day with Çağatay to improve profile tab more. I have implemented profile picture uploading code, whereas he made a new design on profile fragment. Watched some videos to figure out how to use firebase to upload an image from user's own device. Completed my code with a simple error. Now when user switches to profile tab, app crashes. Started searching ways to get rid of this error. 

### ~ [18.05.2020] ~
Found out that the code that I wrote, user class and database do not match. Tried to fix the problem but I couldn't. Worked with Çağatay to see what can we improve more on profile tab. 

### ~ [19.05.2020] ~
Finally managed to get code work. Now user can choose an image from their device, upload it to firebase and use it as their profile picture.
