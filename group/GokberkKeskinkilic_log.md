On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

During our meeting for detailed project report we have brainstormed together to develop our app. I have written the conclusion part for the report. 

### ~ [30.03.2020] ~
During our meeting for GUI presentation, I have written the part for profile tab and homepage for report.

### ~ [23.04.2020] ~ 
After our group meeting, I have googled for about 2-3 hours to find out how to use android studio. Since it is a little bit complicated than developing desktop programmes, I have tried to discover how it actually works to plan our group project. Watched tutorials on YouTube.
