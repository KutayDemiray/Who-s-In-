On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.


### ~ [25.02.2020] ~ 
After having completed the slides together with all group members, we made our project's first presentation with Ceyda.

### ~ [07.03.2020] ~
During our meeting for detailed project report we have brainstormed together to develop our app. I have written the conclusion part for the report. 

### ~ [30.03.2020] ~
During our meeting for GUI presentation, I have written the part for profile tab and homepage for report.

### ~ [23.04.2020] ~ 
After our group meeting, I have googled for about 2-3 hours to find out how to use android studio. Since it is a little bit complicated than developing desktop programmes, I have tried to discover how it actually works to plan our group project. Watched tutorials on YouTube. 

### ~ [29.04.2020] ~
I have continued learning and working Android Studio. After 3 hours, I have completed the mechanic part of tab switching. Created 4 fragments for each tab and attached them into a navigation button. It is now switching through tabs. 

### ~ [02.05.2020] ~
Continued working on the interface of the fragments. Added texts, buttons for each main fragment according to our ui design report. Studied on using buttons to control switching through activites and fragment. Made a random meeting with Ceyda and Gülin to talk about our design. Ceyda sent me the buttons and backgrounds she made and I applied them on xml files.
