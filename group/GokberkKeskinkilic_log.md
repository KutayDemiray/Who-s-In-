On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

After having completed the slides together with all group members, we presented our project's draft with Ceyda.

### ~ [03.30.2020] ~
During our meeting for GUI presentation, I have written the part for profile tab and homepage for report.

### ~ [23.04.2020] ~ 
After our group meeting, I have googled for about 2-3 hours to find out how to use android studio. Since it is a little bit complicated than developing desktop programmes, I have tried to discover how it actually works to plan our group project. Watched tutorials on YouTube.
