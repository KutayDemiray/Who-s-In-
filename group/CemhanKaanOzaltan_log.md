On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 10.02.2020 - 16.02.2020 ~
This week, I met up with a couple of my groupmates in the free lab and brainstormed about multiple project ideas. As our ideas were very distinct from each other, we did not come to a decisive conclusion but gained a general 
perspective of how our project may proceed.

### ~ 20.02.2020 - 26.02.2020 ~
This week, I met up with my group and discussed several project ideas with them. After deciding to create an app for finding others and needed items, we started preparing a requirements stage presentation. I did several corrections 
and changes to make the presentation more accurate, along with my teammates creating partial UI examples and a logo for our app.

### ~ 04.03.2020 - 10.03.2020 ~
After our project presentation, I had another meeting with my group and we decided to take out some of the features our project provided as the feedback we received suggested that our application was too broad. We decided to focus
on finding and hosting different kinds of events. I suggested several ideas to extend the usability of our project such as finding eSports events along with the ideas of my groupmates such as providing the ability to look for board 
game events and gps display of nearby events. Then we started preparing the requirements stage report. I wrote the introduction part and did several corrections after the report was finished.

### ~ 20.03.2020 - 26.03.2020 ~
This week, I had an online meeting with my team and we discussed how we were going to prepare our UI design report. I brainstormed with my team about where certain buttons should be located and how the program should operate in order 
to create an optimal application for the use of the customers.

### ~ 27.03.2020 - 03.04.2020 ~
This week, I met up with my team to prepare the UI design stage report. I provided infromation about how the operation of our application should be displayed in the screens and the storyboard. I then prepared the introduction and
some of the descriptions of the report along with my team preparing the UI visuals and the storyboard.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~
This week, I discussed the detailed design stage of our project with my group. I provided some ideas about how we can form the structure of our design and create the necessarry classes along with my groupmates. We did not know 
much about how Android development worked and how databases were used so we decided to look into these subjects and consult our TA about how our detailed design should be done.In order to gain a general sense about these topics, 
I looked into Android development and how the possible databases we were planning to use such as Google Firebase worked.
