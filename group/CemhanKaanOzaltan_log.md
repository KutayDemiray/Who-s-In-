On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 04.03.2020 - 10.03.2020 ~
During our requirements stage meeting, I brainstormed with my group about our app's features and wrote the introduction part of the report.

### ~ 27.03.2020 - 03.04.2020 ~
During our UI design stage meeting, I talked about our app's UI with my group and wrote the introduction part of the report.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~
After discussing our detailed design with my group, I looked up how Android Studio and databases work on the internet and watched some tutorials on YouTube. Because android development works differently than what we have seen so far, trying to learn it was quite complicated.
