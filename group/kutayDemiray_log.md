On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 10.02.2020 - 16.04.2020 ~
Yağız and I had some free hours and we met in the library to brainstorm some project ideas. We asked others to make this an official meeting, but they had classes and couldn't come.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~
I met unofficially with Yağız on thursday afternoon before our official meeting with rest of the group. We looked at some other mobile app's Github to get a rough idea of how things work, but most of the project was
"activities" and "fragments," which we didn't know anything about. After we noticed that we know nothing about Android design, Yağız called some of his friends that had developed a mobile app before. They talked briefly
about how classes and databases work in a mobile app. After that, Yağız and I bought Android Studio courses form Udemy to learn more about how it works.
