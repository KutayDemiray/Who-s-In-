# CS102 ~ Personal Log page ~

## Cagatay Safak

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### [by 23 March]
I brainstormed with my group, TA and instructor about our app's point and architecture. I also learned basic XML and Android Studio coding.

### [23 March - 29 March]
I did write the first codes of our app on Android Studio and keep on learning new things about Android as much as I can. I watched many YouTube tutorials.

### [30 March - 12 April]
Since I had implemented all the things I've learned about Android Studio to the same project, I did not like that one and started a new project on Android Studio, which is our final project. I also started to share my knowledge with group members, especially with Gokberk.

### [13 April - 26 April]
I created the Log in and Signup screens and made their systems. I also made the main structure of our application, just like fragments and inner activities.

### [27 April - 3 May]
I designed all the screens as Ceyda's design. I made Nearby Fragment. Now, we can search and find desired users through Nearby Fragment.

### [4 May - 17 May]
I designed all the screens as Ceyda's design. I made Profile Fragment. I made the following system. I add the Edit Profile Button and everything inside it. Gokberk helped me on Profile Fragment. Now, i made the Nearby and Profile fragments. I also helped Ceyda and Gulin on Home Fragment design by changing its Layout type.

### [18 May - 31 May]
Since we have finished our project (for Bilkent), I removed unnecessary classes, activities, fragments and drawable members. I also debugged some conflictes which were not shown at Github Desktop.
