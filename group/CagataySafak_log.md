On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ [by 23 March] ~ 
I brainstormed with my group, TA and instructor about our app's point and architecture. I also learned basic XML and Android Studio coding.

### ~ [23 March - 29 March] ~ 
I did write the first codes of our app on Android Studio and keep on learning new things about Android as much as I can. I watched many YouTube tutorials.

### ~ [30 March - 12 April] ~ 
Since I had implemented all the things I've learned about Android Studio to the same project, I did not like that one and started a new project on Android Studio, which is our final project. I also started to share my knowledge with group members, especially with Gokberk.
