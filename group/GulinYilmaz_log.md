We had a group meeting to decide on an idea for our Project and we came up with “Looking For.”

07.03.20
After getting the feedback in the presentation which made us to think that we should narrow down our application’s functions we decided to focus on creating an app called “Who’s In?”. We decided that it will be a platform which will help people to find participations for their events near them.

30.03.20
Some of our group members created rough designs for screens of our app. I wrote the descriptions and functions of some designs to include them in the UI Design report. 

23.04.20 – 30.04.20
On 23.04 we had a group meeting but we noticed that we didn’t know much about the Android Studio, so we decided to study and meet again. I started studying the next day, I bought some courses on Udemy and followed some tutorials on YouTube to learn how to create Android Studio projects. 

01.05.20
Group members had a meeting but I didn’t know about it and I couldn’t join. They decided to share tasks and Ceyda and I are supposed to work on the Graphical User Interface part of the project from now on. 

02.05.20 – 07.05.20
We had a short meeting with Ceyda and Gökberk to create the background of login and welcome screen.
I used to study on how to write simple projects on Android Studio but I didn’t know much about the User Interface so I decided to follow some tutorials to learn UI in Android Studio. While following the tutorials I’ve figured out that using Adobe XD for design is better in terms of creating modern designs so I learned how to use it and create xml files to use in Android Studio from Adobe XD projects.

07.05.20 – 14.05.20 
We basically worked on the design of the fragments of our application with Ceyda. We chose proper colors (got inspired from twitter’s dark mode for the3 bg but we created our own color codes as well), we tried to use minimal icons to give it a more modern look. Ceyda edited some of them on photoshop to give it a better look. I used Adobe XD and wrote some of the xml files. We arranged the fonts and shape of some buttons, constraints of the buttons, bars, text fields and other components in each fragment. I worked on the profile fragment and we changed the design on our mind for home fragment so I changed and worked on constraints and the look of the buttons and text fields and design of home fragment as well. 


14.05.20 – 20.05.20
We worked on our detailed design report I wrote the introduction and conclusion of it and I edited the other parts. Ceyda and I worked on the final design together to give our app its final modern look. I wrote a small class to create the search bar on nearby fragment. Then I started learning how to make small animations on android studio especially for buttons and tried to implement it into our app but since I didn’t push it and my computer crashed afterwards I couldn’t add them into the project, I shouldn’t have left it to the last minute.
 On 20.20 we filmed our demo video to show our app and I edited the  whole video but yağız did the same as well and we uploaded the one he edited because mine was longer than 10 minutes.
