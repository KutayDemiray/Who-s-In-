Contents, Abstracts, Features brainstorming.
With the assistance of the group members, I finished designing the “Looking For…” logo using Adobe Photoshop. I made sure that the assets and layers were in the optimal format and the logo file in the right format in order to prevent future exportation errors ( to Android Studio or other Adobe apps).
