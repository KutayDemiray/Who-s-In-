On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### February 10th - February 16th, 2020
We had brainstorming about what we can do about the project with Kutay. We asked others to make this an official meeting, but they had classes and unfortunately couldn't come at that moment.

### February 17th - February 23rd, 2020
I expanded my thinking with asking my peers and parents what are the problems that they have in their daily lives.

### February 24th - March 1st, 2020
We had couple of meetings to determine our first version of our project and we decided to make an app for university students, add features like hitchhiking, book trade, event creator and etc. We worked on this idea and named it "Looking For". Then, we made our presentation and logo for it with Ceyda.

### March 2nd - March 8th, 2020
We decided to change our project's scope according to the feedbacks from our instructor, TAs and friends. So, we had an meeting and decided to focus more on events and gatherings so that for example other people won't have to play basketball alone!

### March 9th - March 15th, 2020
Not much work this week due to MATH132 midterm and coronavirus situation.

### March 16th - March 22nd, 2020
I looked example source codes for Android apps from GitHub and bought an Udemy course that I learn a little bit...

### April 20th - April 26th, 2020
On April 22nd, I met with Kutay and discussed how can we do the app and get information about on app designing from my high school friends, they designed and published an app on iOS before in high school. On April 23rd, we met as a group about how can we do the detailed design our app, after a while I realized that we lack information on Android designing so, I asked my teammates to learn a bit about Android designing and componentsThis week's weekend I learn how databases work, how Android class organization work, and so on I kind of wrote down the possible classes and objects for our project.

### April 27th - May 3rd, 2020
We tried to make UML diagram with Kutay and Cemhan Kaan, and decided to postpone this after we decide all our model, adapter and controller classes. I took a deep look into how to add in app notification feature and sending notificatons to users with pop up messages to their phones.

### May 4th - May 10th, 2020
I barely looked into my part in the project due to upcoming assignments in ENG102.

### May 11th - May 17th, 2020
I looked some examples for notification feature and then added the required classes and controllers -NotificationAdapter, NotificationFragment- to project. I managed the add notification to follow button -UserAdapter- so that if a person is starting be followed by someone else he or she will get a notification. Then I started to think how can I implement notification to more features. Also, I did the styling of the notification fragment and adapter.

### May 18th - May 24th, 2020
I have created EventActivity page for each unique event so that users can join events and see the events information, description and etc. Also, I added notifications to create, join and leave event. I implemented the required code into CreateEvent, EventActivity classes. I commented my parts of the code and tried to bug fixes on the general of the code. Then, we recorded a video through Zoom despite the current conditions.
