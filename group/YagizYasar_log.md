On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### April 20th - 26th, 2020
On April 22nd, I met with Kutay and discussed how can we do the app and get information about on app designing from my high school friends, they designed and published an app on iOS before in high school. On April 23rd, we met as a group about how can we do the detailed design our app, after a while I realized that we lack information on Android designing so, I asked my teammates to learn a bit about Android designing and componentsThis week's weekend I learn how databases work, how Android class organization work, and so on I kind of wrote down the possible classes and objects for our project.
