name, organizer, duration, time, capacity, current participants, location, event's public status, event code, and a short description. In sports events, there will be the sport type and number and size of teams (if there's more
than two teams, it will count as a tournament). Board game events will include the game type, from which users will pick one of the popular games or the "other" category. User's profile will include nickname, a profile picture,
a short bio, past events, and a friends list (only visible to the users themselves). At the bottom, there will be notifications when an user is invited to an event or when others join.
