Group 2A - Who's In

A mobile app aiming to help organize events by providing easy means of creating, joining and searching events.

Status: Implementing

Users can sign up, sign in and follow others (though any functionality related to following status has not been added yet). Event creation is complete and they can be added to
database. Barebones GUI structure for many screens of the app exist, but they will be improved upon later.

Kutay Demiray:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Made the event creation page, contributed in design of most model classes, especially event related ones (though subclasses Kutay had done such as MeetingEvent or SportsEvent were not implemented for now and instead Event, which would be abstract in the final product, was used for all event types temporarily).

Yağız Yaşar:
Contributed in some of the model classes and to understand the database implementing into code better, made Notification and its subclasses, which won't be implemented in the code because we use database instead, in Text Based Model.

Cemhan Kaan Özaltan:
Created the model classes such as Event and BoardGameEvent and contributed to the rest of the model classes such as EventList. Some of the model classes are not currently used and the Event
class is being used for all event types for now despite initially being abstract and branching to several subclasses.
