Group 2A - Who's In

A mobile app aiming to help organize events by providing easy means of creating, joining and searching events.

Status: Implementing

Users can sign up, sign in and follow others (though any functionality related to following status has not been added yet). Event creation is complete and they can be added to
database. Barebones GUI structure for many screens of the app exist, but they will be improved upon later.

Kutay Demiray:
Made the event creation page, contributed in design of most model classes, especially event related ones (though subclasses Kutay had done such as MeetingEvent or SportsEvent were not
implemented for now and instead Event, which would be abstract in the final product, was used for all event types temporarily).

Gökberk Keskinkılıç:
Implemented the core structure of the android application, such as button and fragment navigations. Added sign out feature.
